# Control over Wireless Networks (COWN)

This project contains source-code for control of large-scale-systems over wireless networks
based on iterative resource allocation and adaptive linear quadratic control. The core of the algorithm is an iterative 
formulation of Q-Learning with function approximation for iterative resource allocation.
